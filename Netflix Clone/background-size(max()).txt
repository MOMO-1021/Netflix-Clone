What actually happens with background-size: max(1200px, 100vw) on an 800px screen:
The browser tries to make the background image 1200px wide (since 1200px is larger than 800px).

BUT the screen itself is only 800px wide, so the image gets cropped (you’ll only see a portion of it).

By default, the left/top part of the image is visible; the rest "spills over" outside the screen.

Why use this code then?
It’s useful if:
You want the image to never shrink below 1200px (to avoid pixelation/blur on large screens).
You don’t mind cropping the image on smaller screens (like mobile).

Key Takeaway:
The image is technically 1200px wide on an 800px screen, but only 800px of it is visible (the rest is hidden).

This is not ideal for most designs unless cropping is intentional.
